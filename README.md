# Financial-Data-Analysis-
In this project I use Python and its libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn &amp; Matplotlib to Analyse and Visualise Finance Data, that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The dataset contains finance data related to investors' preferences for different modes of investment, rated on a scale of 1 to 7. 
The Dataset includes columns such as GENDER, AGE, Do you invest in Investment Avenues?, Mutual Funds, Equity Market, Debentures, Government Bonds, Fixed Deposits, etc.
Through this project I aim to analyse investor behavior and preferences, identify trends in investment choices, and develop investment strategies that align with the preferences of different investor groups by plotting the following charts : 
1. Frequency of Age range by Gender
2. Plotting the Gender of Respondents
3. Plotting Type of Investment with Prefference
4. Plotting Age of Respondents
5. Comparing factors of INVESTMENT_AVENUE & STOCK_MARKET with Gender
6. Comparing the Faactors that affect Investment
7. Plotting Risk Factors by Gender
8. Plotting the Purpose of Investment by Age
9. Plotting the Duration of Investemnt by Gender & Investment Monitoring cycles by Gender
10. Finding out through which source Investors found about the opportunity the most
11.
