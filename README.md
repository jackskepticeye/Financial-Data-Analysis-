# Financial-Data-Analysis-
In this project I use Python and its libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn &amp; Matplotlib to Analyse and Visualise Finance Data, that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The dataset contains finance data related to investors' preferences for different modes of investment, rated on a scale of 1 to 7.
